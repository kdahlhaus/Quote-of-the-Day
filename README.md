# qotd
Simple 'Quote of the Day' web page.  I'm using it for the Version One Team room plugin.

<url> - single quote per day
e.g.: https://kdahlhaus.github.io/Quote-of-the-Day/quote_of_the_day.html

<url>?random - random quote each time it is called
e.g.: https://kdahlhaus.github.io/Quote-of-the-Day/quote_of_the_day.html?random 

<url>?# - #th quote (0 based)
e.g.: https://kdahlhaus.github.io/Quote-of-the-Day/quote_of_the_day.html?3
